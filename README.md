# work isnt being done for now because i broke my arch linux install

# postmarketOS-xcover4lte-bin
status: bootloops 

Uhh so pmOS on the xcover4lte doesn't have internet due to missing binaries, I will be trying to get them from the stock ROM and post them here

notes:
- the mx* files go to /lib/firmware/postmarketos/mx140/

~~- the mfc* files go /lib/firmware/~~ (im seeing if this is the cause for bootlooping)
