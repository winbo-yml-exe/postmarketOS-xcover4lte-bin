Uhh so pmOS on the xcover4lte doesn't have internet due to missing binaries, I will be trying to get them from the stock ROM and post them here

notes:
- you need to make the phone use networkmanager as the supplier
- the mx140* files go to /lib/firmware/postmarketos/mx140/
- the mx file has to go in /lib/firmware/postmarketos/mx140/mx/. if youre confused, i mean that it should be as "/lib/firmware/postmarketos/mx140/mx/mx"
- the mfc* files go /lib/firmware/
